can you create a skill that automates the process of creating a conversation for a PR like i did here? This exact format on the conversation https://github.com/clawdbot/clawdbot/pull/763
```

Assistant:
```
Let me check out that PR to see the format
```

Assistant:
```
Oh nice — this is great documentation. Love the "Prompt history" section showing the actual diagnostic conversation.
```

Assistant:
```
Let me build this out. The skill would:
```

Assistant:
```
The script is working correctly (the hex dump shows "Assistant:" in the file). The "A:" display is just a terminal rendering artifact. Let me test with a larger session to make sure it handles real conversations:
```

Assistant:
```
Done! Created the skill at skills/pr-conversation/
```

Assistant:
```
Usage workflow:
```

Assistant:
```
Want me to test it on a real PR? Or any tweaks to the format first?
```

User:
```
put the skill in your workspace ~/clawd-workspace
```

Assistant:
```
Moved to ~/clawd-workspace/skills/pr-conversation/ ✓

User:

I'd like it to be generalizeable across clawdbot, claude code, codex etc not sure how they differ in how history is stored
```

Assistant:
```
Good call — let me research where each one stores history
```

Assistant:
```
Found the formats! They're all JSONL but structured differently:
```

Assistant:
```
Updating the skill to handle all three. One sec...
```

Assistant:
```
Done! Updated the skill to auto-detect and handle all three formats.
```

Assistant:
```
Usage is the same for all three — just point it at any session file:
```

User:
```
when done test it with this conversation (no actual pr just a test)
```

Assistant:
```
On it — let me find our current session
```

Assistant:
```
Hmm, the raw output is messy — Clawdbot includes all the context/repeats with each turn, and the assistant responses I send to Telegram are in tool calls, not raw text.
```

Assistant:
```
Got it working! Created a clean extraction script for Clawdbot that strips the Telegram metadata.
```

Assistant:
```
Here's a sample of the extracted conversation from our session:
```

Assistant:
```
Assistant:
```

Assistant:
```
One caveat: because I send Telegram messages as separate tool calls (per the formatting rules), assistant responses show up as multiple separate blocks instead of one combined response.
```

Assistant:
```
For PR docs you'd probably want to merge consecutive assistant messages manually. Could add that as a future enhancement.
```

Assistant:
```
The skill now has two extraction scripts:
```

User:
```
can you think of a better name for the skill
```

Assistant:
```
A few ideas:
```

User:
```
let's call it prompt-log and make it just about gettin the transcripts (no pr template). it should just create a markdown file with a descriptive title and date. also let's add nice readable timestamps to the conversation history
```

Assistant:
```
Love it — simpler and more focused. On it.
```

Assistant:
```
Done! Renamed to `prompt-log`, simplified to just transcripts.
```

Assistant:
```

Usage:
```

User:
```
these will ende up getting generated in folders where people are developing projects does a .folder make sense like .prompt-log/file
```

Assistant:
```
Good call — keeps transcripts out of the way. Updating to default to `.prompt-log/`
```

Assistant:
```
Done ✓
```

User:
```
or is that the right pattern
```

Assistant:
```
I think it's solid. Follows the same pattern as `.git/`, `.vscode/`, `.claude/` — hidden, tool-specific, self-explanatory.
```

Assistant:
```
Could add `.prompt-log/` to global gitignore if you don't want transcripts tracked. Or keep them in git as documentation — your call per project.
```

User:
```
looks like it's missing code block formatting now. i don't want the emojis. let's kill the timestamps
```

Assistant:
```
Got it — code blocks, no emojis, no timestamps. Fixing.
```

Assistant:
```
Done ✓

run a full one and put it in appropriate folder in workspace
